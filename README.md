# The GrSyLi package for GAP

The GrSyLi package contains various collections of small graphs with certain 
symmetry properties, and provides functionality for the access to these graphs, 
along with several precomputed properties for each graph available.",
  
## Documentation

Currently, the pdf version of the manual can be found at

  <https://rhysje00.github.io/grsyli/doc/>

After the package is downloaded, it is recommended to build all package 
documentation by running <C>gap path/to/grsyli/makedoc.g</C> from the command 
line. This will build a pdf version of this manual and save it in the directory <C>path/to/grsyli/doc/</C>, as well as provide the &GAP; help viewer with the 
content of the manual. 
<!--
Full information and documentation can be found in the manual, available
as PDF `doc/manual.pdf` or as HTML `doc/chap0.html`, or on the package
homepage at

  <https://rhysje00.github.io/cvt/>
