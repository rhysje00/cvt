<Heading>Arc&ndash;transitive 4&ndash;valent graphs</Heading>

In this Chapter we give functions for accessing the arc-transitive 4-valent 
graphs stored in this package, and related properties. Currently, this package 
contains all arc-transitive 4-valent graphs on up to 640 vertices. For 
information and references about these graphs, see <Cite Key="PSV_2015"/> and 
<Cite Key="PSV_2013b"/>.
<P/>
Let <M>\Gamma</M> be a simple graph (undirected, loopless, without multiple 
edges). Then <M>\Gamma</M> is <E>4-valent</E> (or <E>tetravalent</E>) if each 
vertex of the graph has exactly 4 neighbours.
<P/>
The graph <M>\Gamma</M> is <E>arc-transitive</E> if the automorphism group 
of <M>\Gamma</M> acts transitively on the arcs of <M>\Gamma</M>.

In this Section we give the functions which give information about the 
arc-transitive 4-valent graph library, and the properties and attributes of 
the graphs it contains.
