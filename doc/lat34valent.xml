<Heading>Locally arc&ndash;transitive <M>\{{3,4}\}</M>&ndash;valent graphs</Heading>

In this chapter we give functions for accessing the locally arc-transitive 
<M>\{{3,4}\}</M>-valent graphs stored in this package, and related properties. 
<P/>
In this package, we collect bipartite biregular graphs of valence 
<M>\{{3,4}\}</M> that are locally <M>G</M>-arc-transitive for some group of 
automorphisms <M>G</M> with the edge stabiliser acting faithfully on the union 
of the neighbourhoods of the vertices of the edge. Currently, this package 
stores all such graphs on up to 350 vertices, and many more on up to 1050. For 
more information and references about these graphs, see <Cite Key="P_2012"/>.

<Heading>Accessing the locally arc&ndash;transitive <M>\{{3,4}\}</M>&ndash;valent graphs</Heading>

In this Section we introduce functions for the access to the locally 
arc-transitive <M>\{{3,4}\}</M>-valent graphs stored in the &GRSYLI; package.

<Heading>Properties of the locally arc&ndash;transitive <M>\{{3,4}\}</M>&ndash;valent graphs and library</Heading>

In this Section we give the functions which give information about the 
locally arc-transitive <M>\{{3,4}\}</M>-valent graph library, and the properties and attributes of 
the graphs it contains.
