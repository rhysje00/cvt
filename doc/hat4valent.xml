<Heading>Half&ndash;arc&ndash;transitive graphs</Heading>

In this Chapter we give functions for accessing the half-arc-transitive 
4-valent graphs stored in this package, and related properties. Currently, this package 
contains all half-arc-transitive 4-valent graphs on up to 1000 vertices. For information 
and references on these graphs, see <Cite Key="PSV_2013a"/>.
<P/>
Let <M>\Gamma</M> be a simple graph (undirected, loopless, without multiple 
edges). Then <M>\Gamma</M> is <E>4-valent</E> (or <E>tetravalent</E>) if each 
vertex of the graph has exactly 4 neighbours.
<P/>
The graph <M>\Gamma</M> is <E>half-arc-transitive</E> if the automorphism group
of <M>\Gamma</M> acts transitively on the vertices and edges of <M>\Gamma</M>, 
but not on the arcs of <M>\Gamma</M>.

In this Section we introduce functions for the access to the 
half-arc-transitive 4-valent graphs stored in the &GRSYLI; package.

<Heading>Properties of the half&ndash;arc&ndash;transitive 4&ndash;valent graphs and library</Heading>

In this Section we give the functions which give information about the 
half-arc-transitive 4-valent graph library, and the properties and attributes of 
the graphs it contains.

<Subsection Label="Precomputed data hat">
<Heading>Precomputed attributes of the half&ndash;arc&ndash;transitive 4&ndash;valent graphs</Heading>

For a given half-arc-transitive 4-valent graph <M>\Gamma</M> stored in this package, 
there are several precomputed attributes stored in the &GRSYLI; package. These 
include the following:

<List>
<Item> Girth of <M>\Gamma</M> 
       (<Ref BookName="digraphs" Attr="DigraphUndirectedGirth"/>). </Item>
<Item> Bipartiteness of <M>\Gamma</M>
       (<Ref BookName="digraphs" Prop="IsBipartiteDigraph"/>). </Item>
<Item> Arc-transitivity of <M>\Gamma</M> 
       (<Ref Prop="IsArcTransitiveDigraph"/>). </Item>
<Item>The Cayleyness of <M>\Gamma</M>
      (<Ref Prop="IsCayleyGraph"/>).</Item>
<!-- <Item>The size of the stabilizer of a vertex in the automorphism group
      of <M>\Gamma</M> (<Ref Attr="SizeStabAut"/>).</Item>   
<Item>The solvability of the automorphism group of <M>\Gamma</M>
      (<Ref Prop="HasSolvableAutGroup"/>).</Item>
<Item>The radius of <M>\Gamma</M> 
      (see <Ref Attr="AlterCycleRadius"/>).</Item>
<Item>The attachment number of <M>\Gamma</M> 
      (see <Ref Attr="AlterCycleAttachmentNr"/>).</Item>
<Item>The attachment type of <M>\Gamma</M> 
      (see <Ref Attr="AlterCycleAttachmentType"/>).</Item>
<Item>The alter-exponent of <M>\Gamma</M> 
      (see <Ref Attr="AlterExponent"/>).</Item>
<Item>The alter-perimeter of <M>\Gamma</M> 
      (see <Ref Attr="AlterPerimeter"/>).</Item>
<Item>The alter-sequence of <M>\Gamma</M> 
      (see <Ref Attr="AlterSequence"/>).</Item> -->
<Item>The length of the shortest consistent cycle in <M>\Gamma</M> 
      (see <Ref Attr="ConsistentCycleTypes"/>).</Item>
<Item>The length of the longest consistent cycle in <M>\Gamma</M> 
      (see <Ref Attr="ConsistentCycleTypes"/>).</Item>
<!-- <Item>The meta-circulant types of <M>\Gamma</M> 
      (see <Ref Attr="HAT4ValentMetaCirculantClasses"/>).</Item> -->
</List>

</Subsection>

Now we introduce functions which are used to find information about
the library and each of the graphs it stores.
