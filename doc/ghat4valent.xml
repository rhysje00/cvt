<Heading>The <M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive graph library</Heading>

In this Chapter we give functions for accessing the <M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive 
4 valent graphs stored in this package, and related properties. Currently, this package 
contains all <M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive 4 valent on up to 1000 vertices. For information 
and references on these graphs, see <Cite Key="PSV_2013a"/>.
<P/>
Let <M>\Gamma</M> be a simple graph (undirected, loopless, without multiple 
edges). Then <M>\Gamma</M> is <E>4-valent</E> (or <E>tetravalent</E>) if each 
vertex of the graph has exactly 4 neighbours.
<P/>
The graph <M>\Gamma</M> is <M>G</M><E>-half-arc-transitive</E> if <M>G</M> is a group
of automorphisms of <M>\Gamma</M> which acts transitively on the vertices and edges of 
<M>\Gamma</M>, but not on the arcs of <M>\Gamma</M>.

<Heading>Global variables for the <M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive 4-valent graph library</Heading>

In this Section we introduce functions and variables which give information
about the <M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive 4-valent graph library and the graphs stored within.

In this Section we introduce functions for the access to the 
<M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive 4-valent graphs stored in the &GRSYLI; package.

<Section Label="Properties and attributes ghat">
<Heading>Properties and attributes of the <M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive 4-valent graphs</Heading>

In this Section we give the properties and attributes of the 
<M>G</M>-half-arc-transitive 4-valent graphs which are stored in this library.

<Subsection Label="Properties from the Digraphs package ghat">
<Heading>Properties from the &DIGRAPHS; package</Heading>

A few of the properties we have precomputed for the graphs of this library 
are already defined in the &DIGRAPHS; package. These are;

<List>
<Item> Diameter, in the attribute 
       <Ref BookName="digraphs" Attr="DigraphDiameter"/>. </Item>
<Item> Girth, in the attribute 
       <Ref BookName="digraphs" Attr="DigraphUndirectedGirth"/>. </Item>
<Item> Bipartiteness, in the property 
       <Ref BookName="digraphs" Prop="IsBipartiteDigraph"/>. </Item>
<Item> Arc-transitivity, in the property 
       <Ref BookName="digraphs" Prop="IsEdgeTransitive"/>. </Item>
</List>

Whenever we wish to store these as &GAP; properties or attributes, we will use 
the aforementioned &DIGRAPHS; functionality. We also give a synonym for 
arc-transitivity, <Ref Prop="IsArcTransitiveDigraph"/>.  

</Subsection>

Now we introduce properties and attributes which have been 
precomputed and stored in the &GRSYLI; package, and are not defined in the 
functionality of the &DIGRAPHS; package.
