<Chapter Label="prop">
<Heading>Properties and attributes of the cubic vertex-transitive graphs</Heading>

In this chapter we give the properties and attributes of the graphs which are
stored in this library.

<Section Label="Properties from the Digraphs package">
<Heading>Properties from the &DIGRAPHS; package</Heading>

A few of the properties we have precomputed for the graphs of this library 
are already defined in the &DIGRAPHS; package. These are;

<List>
<Item> Diameter, in the attribute 
       <Ref BookName="digraphs" Attr="DigraphDiameter"/>. </Item>
<Item> Girth, in the attribute 
       <Ref BookName="digraphs" Attr="DigraphUndirectedGirth"/>. </Item>
<Item> Bipartiteness, in the property 
       <Ref BookName="digraphs" Prop="IsBipartiteDigraph"/>. </Item>
<Item> Arc-transitivity, in the property 
       <Ref BookName="digraphs" Prop="IsEdgeTransitive"/>. </Item>
</List>

Whenever we wish to store these as &GAP; properties or attributes, we will use 
the aforementioned &DIGRAPHS; functionality. We also give a synonym for 
arc-transitivity, <Ref Prop="IsArcTransitiveDigraph"/>.  

</Section>

<Section Label="Properties from the CVT package">
<Heading>Properties from the &CVT; package</Heading>

In this Section we introduce properties and attributes which have been 
precomputed and stored in the &CVT; package, and are not defined in the 
functionality of the &DIGRAPHS; package.
