<Heading>The edge-transitive 4-valent graph library</Heading>

In this chapter we give functions for accessing the edge-transitive 4-valent 
graphs stored in this package, and related properties. Currently, this package
contains an incomplete list of edge-transitive 4-valent graphs on up to 512 
vertices. For information and references about these graphs, see 
<Cite Key="PW_2016"/>.
<P/>
Let <M>\Gamma</M> be a simple graph (undirected, loopless, without multiple 
edges). Then <M>\Gamma</M> is <E>4-valent</E> (or <E>tetravalent</E>) if each 
vertex of the graph has exactly 4 neighbours.
<P/>
The graph <M>\Gamma</M> is <E>edge-transitive</E> if the automorphism group 
of <M>\Gamma</M> acts transitively on the edges of <M>\Gamma</M>.
