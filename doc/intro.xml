<Index Key="CVT">&CVT; package overview</Index>

  This is the manual for the &CVT; package version &VERSION;.
  <P/>
  The &CVT; package contains all connected cubic vertex-transitive graphs on at most 1280
  vertices, and provides functionality for the access to these graphs, along 
  with several precomputed properties for each graph available.
  <P/>
  All of the functions in this package deal with finite simple graphs in 
  &DIGRAPHS; format <Cite Key="DIGRAPHS_2019"/>.

To install the &CVT; package, you will need to download the most recent 
<C>tar.gz</C> file, found at &PKGWWWHOME;. Once downloaded, you can install the 
package by following the instructions found in the &GAP; reference manual, 
<URL Text="chapter 76">https://docs.gap-system.org/doc/ref/chap76.html</URL>.
<P/>
The &CVT; package requires the following &GAP; packages:
<List>
<Item><Package>GAPDoc</Package> <Cite Key="GAPDOC_2019"/>, version 1.6.6 or higher;</Item>
<Item><Package>Digraphs</Package> <Cite Key="DIGRAPHS_2019"/>, version 1.6.1 or higher.</Item>
</List>
Each of the above packages are part of the standard &GAP; distribution.

  If you use the &CVT; package in your research, please tell us about it by 
  emailing <Email>rhysjevans00@gmail.com</Email>. We are interested in any research
  involving the use of the &CVT; package and might refer to your work in the future.
  
  If you wish to refer to the &CVT; package in a published work, please cite 
  &CVT; like a journal article. The following is a BibTeX entry for the
  current &CVT; version:

<Heading>Examples of the use of &CVT;</Heading>

We will give a simple example of how to use the &CVT; package here.

In this example, we will examine the cubic vertex-transitive graphs with 
<M>50</M> vertices.
