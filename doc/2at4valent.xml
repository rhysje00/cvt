<Heading>2&ndash;arc&ndash;transitive 4&ndash;valent graphs</Heading>

In this Chapter we give functions for accessing the 2-arc-transitive 4-valent 
graphs stored in this package, and related properties. Currently, this package 
contains all 2-arc-transitive 4-valent graphs on up to 727 vertices, and many
more on up to 2000 vertices. For information and references about these graphs,
see <Cite Key="P_2009"/>.
<P/>
Let <M>\Gamma</M> be a simple graph (undirected, loopless, without multiple 
edges). Then <M>\Gamma</M> is <E>4-valent</E> (or <E>tetravalent</E>) if each 
vertex of the graph has exactly 4 neighbours.
<P/>
The graph <M>\Gamma</M> is <E>2-arc-transitive</E> if the automorphism group 
of <M>\Gamma</M> acts transitively on the 2-arcs of <M>\Gamma</M>.
